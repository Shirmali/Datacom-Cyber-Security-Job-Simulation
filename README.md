# Datacom-Cyber-Security-Job-Simulation    
Objective: The aim of this project is to investigate a cyberattack and conduct a comprehensive risk assessment with Datacom  

<li>
Gain hands-on experience with real-world cybersecurity threats.</li>
<li>Utilize Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools to investigate Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), specifically focusing on APT34.</li>
<li>Apply the MITRE ATT&CK Framework to identify and categorize threats and vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Assess and document the impact of cyberattacks on organizational information security.</li>
<li>Develop a defense strategy to prevent future attacks on clients' networks and systems.</li>
<hr/>

<h1>Skills Learned</h1>

<li>OSINT Techniques: Gained proficiency in gathering information on threat actors using OSINT tools such as Shodan, Maltego, and theharvester.</li>

<li>Threat Intelligence & Analysis: Investigated and analyzed APT34, a well-known threat group, to assess its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for identifying risks to organizational security.</li>

<li>MITRE ATT&CK Framework: Applied the framework to map out attack vectors, allowing for the identification and mitigation of security risks.</li>

<li>Risk Assessment & Mitigation: Conducted a detailed risk assessment of potential vulnerabilities, determining risk ratings based on likelihood and consequences, and proposed risk mitigation strategies.</li>

<li>Incident Response: Documented and analyzed an incident where customer data and intellectual property were stolen, outlining key steps to remediate the breach and prevent future attacks. </li>

<li>Report Writing & Documentation: Compiled findings into a comprehensive report, which included risk scenarios, risk ratings, and mitigation strategies tailored for the client. </li>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<strong>Task 1:</strong> APT breach: Analysing the impact on information security - Investigate a cyber attack and produce a comprehensive report documenting your findings and outline key recommendations for improving a client's cybersecurity posture.

<strong>Background:</strong> In this task, you will be stepping into the role of a cybersecurity consultant here at Datacom. One of our leading tech corporation clients has fallen prey to a sophisticated cyberattack by a notorious Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group known as APT34. The attack, believed to be sponsored by a foreign government, has left the organisation's network compromised, and valuable customer data and intellectual property has been stolen.Your mission is to conduct initial research on this APT group, APT34, and assess the extent of the breach's impact on the organisation's information security. But fear not, for you will be provided with all the necessary tools required to understand cybersecurity concepts and principles, including cyberthreats, attack methods, and the importance of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. In addition, you will also be familiarised with APT34's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and the common vulnerabilities they exploit to gain access to networks.The objective of this task is to help our client conduct an initial investigation into APT34 and evaluate the potential impact of the attack on the organization. As a result, you will need to produce a comprehensive report documenting your findings and outlining key recommendations for improving the organisation's cybersecurity posture.

---> As a cybersecurity professional, I successfully utilized various Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools and techniques to gather critical information on APT34. By leveraging the available resources and conducting independent research, I was able to compile detailed intelligence on the group's activities, including their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Additionally, I applied the MITRE ATT&CK Framework to systematically identify and categorize APT34's cyberthreats. Using this framework, I developed a comprehensive defense strategy tailored to protect the client's networks and systems against future attacks, enhancing their overall security posture.

I used the following OSINT tools to gather information about APT34:

<li>MITRE ATT&CK <a href= "https://attack.mitre.org/"> </li>

<li>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</li>

<li>US-CERT</li>

<li>Mandiant Security Blog</li>

<li>CrowdStrike</li>

<li>Recorded Future</li>

<li>CyberScoop</li>

<li>Dark Reading</li>

<li>The CyberWire</li>

<li>SecureWorks</li>

<li>ThreatConnect</li>

<ol><li>What is their history?</li></ol>

APT34, also known as OilRig, is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group that has been active since at least 2014. It has been linked to numerous cyber espionage campaigns that primarily target organizations in the Middle East. The group is known for highly strategic, long-term campaigns where it remains hidden in networks for extended periods, exfiltrating data and conducting espionage activities. APT34 primarily focuses on sectors such as telecommunications, government, financial institutions, and critical infrastructure.

Which nation/state are they associated with?
APT34 is suspected to be linked to Iran. Multiple reports, including those from cybersecurity firms and government entities, suggest that APT34 operates under or is associated with Iran's government or military apparatus, focusing on advancing Iran's strategic objectives in cyber warfare and espionage.

Do they target specific industries?
Yes, APT34 targets specific industries that align with geopolitical and economic interests. The industries commonly targeted include:

•Telecommunications: They target telecom companies to monitor communications or compromise network infrastructure.

•Government agencies: Focus on accessing sensitive state information and diplomatic communications.

•Financial institutions: Attempts to gather sensitive financial data or disrupt banking systems.

•Critical infrastructure: Includes energy and oil sectors, where attacks could impact energy distribution and national security.

•Aerospace and Defense: Steal sensitive technical data for military or technological advancements.

<ol>What are their motives?</ol>
The primary motive of APT34 is cyber espionage. The group focuses on gathering intelligence from sectors vital to national security, defense, economic strategy, and geopolitical interests. Their targets often include government organizations, corporations, and critical infrastructure to gain insights that can be used to enhance their nation’s position in international affairs. Additionally, they aim to disrupt operations or gather intelligence for strategic advantages in negotiations or conflicts.

What are the TTPs they use to conduct their attacks?

APT34’s Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) have been documented through investigations and threat analysis reports. The group uses a mix of custom-developed malware, publicly available tools, and spear-phishing techniques. They often leverage vulnerabilities in Microsoft products and web servers. Their TTPs align with various phases of the MITRE ATT&CK framework as follows:
